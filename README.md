# fountain

_fountain_ is an experimental Golang package for working with Fountain formatted Screenplays. 
_fountain_ is supported by many programs (see list at [fountain.io](https://fountain.io)).  
This package also includes a demonstration command line program called [fountainfmt](docs/) 
which pretty print a fountain document.
